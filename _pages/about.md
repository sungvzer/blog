title: About me
---

Hi! My name is Salvatore, and I'm a 19-year-old backend developer.

I started learning to code at around the age of thirteen, lured in by wanting to create new Minecraft mods.

As I grew up, I managed to learn more and more topics, aided by attending a CS-oriented high school.

To this day, I am still passionate about tech stuff, be it hardware or software, but I've also broadened my interests, from photography to motor racing.

## Favorite pieces of tech

Some - definitely not all - of the technology I admire the most:

* [The Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/): one of my favorite programming languages
* [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/): no introduction needed really
* [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/): something I think will really impact the future of web-development
* Containers: the solution to - and cause of - many application deployment problems
* [DLSS](https://www.nvidia.com/it-it/geforce/technologies/dlss/): a ground-breaking technology in the gaming field

## My hobbies

* Hitting the gym 🏋🏻‍♂️
* Photography 📸
* Open Source Projects 🧪
* Reading books 📖
* Listening to music 🎵
* Cooking 🍳
* Gaming 🎮

## The aim of this blog

I'm not really sure whether to place this blog as one of the many tech-related blogs out there, or as a more personal project.

Only time will tell, as of now, this is _sungvzer's blog_.
